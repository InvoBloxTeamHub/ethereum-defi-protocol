# Aave V3 Contracts Builder

## Overview

This package installs the Aave V3 smart contract ABIs, which are included in compiled form in the @aave/core-v3 package.

You should use this package from the top-level Makefile with:

    make aavev3

The Makefile will clean up the installed ABI JSON files and copy them into the right place.
